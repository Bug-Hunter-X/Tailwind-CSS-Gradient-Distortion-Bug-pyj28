# Tailwind CSS Gradient Distortion Bug

This repository demonstrates a bug encountered when using Tailwind CSS's gradient functionality. The gradient appears distorted or fails to render as expected.  The `bug.html` file showcases the issue.  The solution, found in `bugSolution.html`, addresses the problem by ensuring proper handling of the gradient direction and color stops.

## Steps to Reproduce
1. Clone the repository.
2. Open `bug.html` in your browser.
3. Observe the distorted gradient.
4. Open `bugSolution.html` and compare the corrected gradient.

## Solution
The issue was resolved by ensuring the correct implementation of the `bg-gradient-to-r` utility and reviewing any potential conflicts with other Tailwind directives.
